                Sure, here's a Python function that solves the problem:

```python
def solution():
    current_short_bushes = 37
    current_tall_trees = 30
    new_short_bushes = 20

    total_short_bushes = current_short_bushes + new_short_bushes

    print(f"target: {total_short_bushes:.0f}")
```

Explanation:

1. We first define the inputs as variables: `current_short_bushes`, `current_tall_trees`, and `new_short_bushes`.
2. We calculate the total number of short bushes by adding the current number of short bushes and the new number of short bushes to be planted: `total_short_bushes = current_short_bushes + new_short_bushes`.
3. We print the result in the format required by the client: `print(f"target: {total_short_bushes:.0f}")`

Note: The `f` string notation is used to include the variable `total_short_bushes` in the string, and the `:.0f` format specifier is used to round the number to two decimal places.
