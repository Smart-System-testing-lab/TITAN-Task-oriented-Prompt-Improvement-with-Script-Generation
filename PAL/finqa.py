                Sure, here's a Python function that calculates the percent change in indemnified securities financing between 2006 and 2007 using the given inputs:
```python
def solution():
    indemnified_financing_2007 = 558368
    indemnified_financing_2006 = 506032
    liquidity_asset_purchase_agreements_2007 = 35339
    liquidity_asset_purchase_agreements_2006 = 30251
    unfunded_commitments_to_extend_credit_2007 = 17533
    unfunded_commitments_to_extend_credit_2006 = 16354
    standby_letters_of_credit_2007 = 4711
    standby_letters_of_credit_2006 = 4926

    difference = indemnified_financing_2007 - indemnified_financing_2006
    percent_change = (difference / indemnified_financing_2006) * 100

    print(f"target: {difference}")
    print(f"percent change: {percent_change:.2f}%")
```
The function takes no arguments, as all the necessary values are provided as inputs in the question. It first calculates the difference between the two amounts, then divides it by the original amount to get the percent change. Finally, it prints the result in the format requested.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `indemnified_financing_2007 = 558368`: This line sets the value of indemnified securities financing in 2007 to $558,368.
2. `indemnified_financing_2006 = 506032`: This line sets the value of indemnified securities financing
