        animals_per_day = total_animals // num_days

        # Print the result
        print(f"Target: {animals_per_day:.2f}")

The code calculates the total number of animals by adding up the number of dogs, cats, birds, and horses. Then, it divides the total number of animals by the number of days in the week to find the number of animals per day. Finally, it prints the result in the format requested.

It's important to note that the number of animals per day will be a float number, that's why I'm using the f-string to print the result with two decimal places.
