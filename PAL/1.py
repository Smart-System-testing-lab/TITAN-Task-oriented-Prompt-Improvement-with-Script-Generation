                Sure, here's a possible implementation of the `solution()` function in Python:
```python
def solution():
    boys = 11
    girls = 45
    group_size = 7

    total_members = boys + girls
    groups = total_members // group_size

    print(f"target: {groups}")
```
This function takes no input, as the values for `boys`, `girls`, and `group_size` are hardcoded. It first calculates the total number of members in the debate team by adding the number of boys and girls. Then, it divides the total number of members by the group size to find the number of groups that can be formed. Finally, it prints the result using the format string `"target: {groups}"`, where `{groups}` is the number of groups that can be formed.

When you run this function, it should print `target: 8`, which is the answer to the question.
