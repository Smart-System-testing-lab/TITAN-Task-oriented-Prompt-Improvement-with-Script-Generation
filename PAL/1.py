                Sure, here's a Python function that solves the problem:

```
def solution():
    weekly_spending = 3
    lawn_mowing_income = 9
    weed_eating_income = 18

    total_income = lawn_mowing_income + weed_eating_income
    money_left = total_income - weekly_spending
    number_of_weeks = money_left // weekly_spending

    print(f"The money will last {number_of_weeks} weeks.")
```

This function takes no input, as all the necessary values are hardcoded within the function itself. It first calculates the total income that Luke has, then subtracts his weekly spending to find out how much money he has left. Finally, it divides the amount of money left by his weekly spending to find out how many weeks the money will last. The result is then printed to the console.
