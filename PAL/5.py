"""
                Sure, here's a Python function that solves the problem:

```
def solution():
    jason_blue = 43
    jason_red = 16
    tom_blue = 24

    total_blue = jason_blue + tom_blue

    print(f"target : {total_blue}")
```

The function takes no input, as all the necessary values are provided in the question. It simply calculates the total number of blue marbles by adding Jason's blue marbles, Jason's red marbles, and Tom's blue marbles, and then prints the result in the required format.
