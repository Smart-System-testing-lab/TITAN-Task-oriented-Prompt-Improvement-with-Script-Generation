                Sure, here's a possible implementation of the `solution()` function in Python:
```python
def solution():
    total_pages = 10.2 + 8.6
    print(f"Target: {total_pages}")
```
This function simply adds the two given numbers and stores the result in the `total_pages` variable. Then, it prints the result in the format specified in the question, using the `f` string notation to include the value of `total_pages` in the output.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

* `total_pages = 10.2 + 8.6`: This line adds the two given numbers and assigns the result to the `total_pages` variable.
* `print(f"Target: {total_pages}"): This line prints the string "Target: " followed by the value of `total_pages`. The `f` string notation allows us to include the value of `total_pages` in the string.

Note that this code assumes that the input values are floating-point numbers. If the inputs are integers, you can use `int` instead of `float` to convert the values to integers before adding them.
