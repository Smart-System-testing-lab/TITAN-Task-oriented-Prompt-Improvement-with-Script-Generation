                Sure, here's a possible implementation of the `solution()` function in Python:
```python
def solution():
    initial_water = 3
    water_added = 6.8
    total_water = initial_water + water_added
    print(f"target: {total_water}")
```
This function takes no input, as the values for the initial water in the bucket and the water added by Derek are hardcoded. It simply calculates the total amount of water in the bucket after Derek adds water and prints the result in the format requested.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `initial_water = 3`: This line sets the initial amount of water in the bucket to 3 gallons.
2. `water_added = 6.8`: This line sets the amount of water added by Derek to 6.8 gallons.
3. `total_water = initial_water + water_added`: This line calculates the total amount of water in the bucket after Derek adds water by adding the initial amount of water to the amount of water added.
4. `print(f"target: {total_water}"): This line prints the result in the format requested, which is "target: X.X", where X.X is the total amount of water in the bucket after Derek adds water.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
