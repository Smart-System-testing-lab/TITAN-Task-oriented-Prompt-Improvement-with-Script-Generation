                Sure, here's a runnable Python function that solves the problem:
```python
def solution():
    # Assumption: e is equal to h
    e_is_h = True

    # Define the two words
    reach = "reach"
    rcach = "rcach"

    # Check if the words are spelled differently
    if e_is_h:
        # Replace all e's with h's in reach
        reach_h = reach.replace("e", "h")
        # Check if reach and rcach are spelled the same
        if reach_h == rcach:
            result = 0
        else:
            result = 1
    else:
        result = 1

    print(f"Target: {result}")
```
Here's how the code works:

1. First, we define two variables: `e_is_h` to represent the assumption that e is equal to h, and `reach` and `rcach` to represent the two words we want to compare.
2. We then check if the words are spelled differently by replacing all e's with h's in `reach` using the `replace()` method. We store the modified word in `reach_h`.
3. We then compare `reach_h` and `rcach` using the `==` operator. If they are the same, we set `result` to 0, indicating no spelling difference. If they are different, we set `result` to 1, indicating a spelling difference.
4. Finally, we print the result using the `print()` function, along with the message "Target: {result}".

Note that the code assumes that the input words `reach` and `rcach` are strings. If they are not strings, the code may raise a TypeError. Additionally, the code assumes that the assumption `e is equal to h` is true. If this assumption is false, the code may produce incorrect results.
