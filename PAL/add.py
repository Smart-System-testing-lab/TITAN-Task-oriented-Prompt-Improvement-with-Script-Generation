                Sure, here's a Python function that solves the problem:
```python
def solution():
    # Katies team won their dodgeball game and scored 12 points total
    total_points = 12

    # Katie scored 4 of the points
    katie_points = 4

    # Everyone else scored 4 points each
    num_players = (total_points - katie_points) / 4

    # Print the number of players on Katies team
    print(f"target: {num_players + 1}")
```
Explanation:

1. First, we define the total number of points scored by Katies team, which is 12.
2. Next, we define the number of points scored by Katie, which is 4.
3. We then calculate the number of points scored by everyone else on the team by subtracting Katie's points from the total points and dividing by 4. This gives us the number of players on the team.
4. Finally, we print the number of players on Katies team, which is the answer to the client's question.

Note that we don't need to ask the user for any input, as all the necessary information is provided in the problem statement.
