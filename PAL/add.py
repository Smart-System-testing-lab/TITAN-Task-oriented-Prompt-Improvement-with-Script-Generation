        album3_pictures = remaining_pictures % 2

        print("Target:", album2_pictures + album3_pictures)

This code first defines the total number of pictures uploaded by Nancy (41), the number of pictures in the first album (37), and the remaining pictures (41 - 37 = 4).

It then calculates the number of pictures that can be divided equally among the remaining two albums (album2_pictures = 4 // 2 = 2, and album3_pictures = 4 % 2 = 2).

Finally, it prints the output in the format requested (target: 2), indicating that there are 2 pictures in each of the two albums.

It's worth noting that this solution assumes that the remaining two albums have equal number of pictures. If the problem statement intended to allow for unequal number of pictures in the two albums, the solution would need to be modified accordingly.
