Here's a step-by-step guide on how to approach this problem:\n\nStep 1: Understand the problem\nThe client is baking a cake, and the recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar, 10 cups of flour, and 15 cups of salt. The client has already put in 6 cups of flour. The goal is to determine how many more cups of flour the client needs to add.\n\nStep 2: Identify the known quantities\nThe known quantities in this problem are:\n\n* 3 cups of sugar\n* 10 cups of flour (6 cups have already been added)\n* 15 cups of salt\n\nStep 3: Identify the unknown quantity\nThe unknown quantity in this problem is the number of cups of flour the client needs to add.\n\nStep 4: Set up the equation\nLet's say the client needs to add x cups of flour. We can set up an equation based on the recipe:\n\n3 cups of sugar + 10 cups of flour (6 cups have already been added) + 15 cups of salt = Total amount of ingredients needed\n\nStep 5: Solve the equation\nWe can solve the equation by subtracting the amount of flour already added (6 cups) from the total amount of flour needed (10 cups):\n\n3 cups of sugar + 10 cups of flour - 6 cups of flour + 15 cups of salt = Total amount of ingredients needed\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n3 cups of sugar + 4 cups of flour + 15 cups of salt = Total amount of ingredients needed\n\nStep 6: Find the solution\nTo find the solution, we need to calculate the total amount of ingredients needed.

How many customers did he have at the start?\"\n\nThe question is asking us to find the number of customers the waiter had at the start, given that he had 12 customers after 9 customers left.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can break it down into the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the information given in the question.\n\nThe question gives us the following information:\n\n* The waiter had some customers.\n* After 9 customers left, the waiter still had 12 customers.\n\nStep 2: Define the problem.\n\nThe problem is to find the number of customers the waiter had at the start.\n\nStep 3: Think of a plan to solve the problem.\n\nOne way to solve this problem is to use a process of elimination.

We know that x + 9 = 12, because the waiter had 12 customers after 9 customers left.\n\nNow, we can solve for x by subtracting 9 from both sides of the equation:\n\nx + 9 = 12\nx = 3\n\nSo, the waiter had 3 customers after 9 customers left.\n\nStep 5: Check your answer.\n\nTo check our answer, we can plug it back into the original equation:\n\nx + 9 = 12\n3 + 9 = 12\n12 = 12\n\nThis shows that our answer is correct.

So, the number of birds sitting on the fence initially is 3.\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of storks sitting on the fence initially.\nThe client doesn't mention anything about the number of storks sitting on the fence initially, so we can assume that there were no storks sitting on the fence initially.\n\nStep 3: Determine the number of storks that join the birds on the fence.\nThe client tells us that 6 more storks join the birds on the fence. So, the number of storks that join the birds on the fence is 6.\n\nStep 4: Determine the number of birds that join the birds on the fence.\nThe client tells us that 2 more birds join the birds on the fence.
