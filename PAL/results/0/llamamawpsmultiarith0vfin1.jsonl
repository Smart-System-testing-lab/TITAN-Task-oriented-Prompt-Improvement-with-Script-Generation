The question asks how many shirts Sam did not wash by the time school started.\n\nStep 2: Identify the information given\nThe problem provides the following information:\n\n* Number of short sleeve shirts Sam had to wash: 40\n* Number of long sleeve shirts Sam had to wash: 23\n* Number of shirts Sam had washed by the time school started: 29\n\nStep 3: Determine what needs to be found\nThe problem asks how many shirts Sam did not wash by the time school started. In other words, we need to find out how many shirts Sam still had to wash.\n\nStep 4: Break down the problem into smaller parts\nTo find out how many shirts Sam did not wash, we can subtract the number of shirts he had washed (29) from the total number of shirts he had to wash (40 + 23 = 63).\n\nStep 5: Solve the problem\nNow, we can calculate the number of shirts Sam did not wash:\n\n63 - 29 = 34\n\nTherefore, Sam did not wash 34 shirts by the time school started.\n\nSo, the ultimate goal is to find the number of shirts Sam did not wash, which is 34.", "inputs": "Sure, here's a dictionary of the inputs mentioned in the client's query:\n\n{\n\"Input Name\": \"Number of short sleeve shirts\",\n\"Value\": 40\n}\n{\n\"Input Name\": \"Number of long sleeve shirts\",\n\"Value\": 23\n}\n{\n\"Input Name\": \"Number of shirts washed by school start\",\n\"Value\": 29\n}\n\nThe client's question is asking about the number of shirts that were not washed by the time school started, which can be calculated by subtracting 29 (the number of shirts washed) from the total number of shirts (40 + 23 = 63). Therefore, the answer to the client's question is 34 (63 - 29)."}

The client says that Kaleb sold 17 of his books.\n3. Now, we need to find out how much money Kaleb earned from selling his books. We don't have information about the price of each book, so we can't calculate the exact amount of money Kaleb earned. However, we can assume that Kaleb sold all 17 books for the same price, let's call it x.\n4. After selling his books, Kaleb used the money he earned to buy new books. The client mentions that Kaleb bought 7 new books.\n5. Finally, we need to find out how many books Kaleb has now. To do this, we need to add the number of books Kaleb had initially (34) to the number of new books he bought (7).\n\nSo, the final goal is to find out how many books Kaleb has now, which is:\n\n34 (initial books) + 7 (new books) = ?\n\nNow, you can solve the problem by filling in the missing number.", "inputs": "Sure, here's a dictionary of the inputs mentioned in the client's query:\n\nInputs:\n\n1.

First, we define the three variables that represent the number of chocolate chip cookies, oatmeal cookies, and cookies per bag.\n2. Next, we calculate the number of bags for each type of cookie by dividing the number of cookies by the number of cookies per bag. We use the // operator to perform integer division and get the integer part of the result.\n3. Then, we add the number of bags for each type of cookie to get the total number of bags.\n4. Finally, we print the result using the print() function, with the format string \"Target: {total_bags}\".
