The question asks how many shirts Sam did not wash by the time school started.\n\nStep 2: Identify the information given\nThe problem provides the following information:\n\n* Number of short sleeve shirts Sam had to wash: 40\n* Number of long sleeve shirts Sam had to wash: 23\n* Number of shirts Sam had washed by the time school started: 29\n\nStep 3: Determine what needs to be found\nThe problem asks how many shirts Sam did not wash by the time school started. In other words, we need to find out how many shirts Sam still had to wash.\n\nStep 4: Break down the problem into smaller parts\nTo find out how many shirts Sam did not wash, we can subtract the number of shirts he had washed (29) from the total number of shirts he had to wash (40 + 23 = 63).\n\nStep 5: Solve the problem\nNow, we can calculate the number of shirts Sam did not wash:\n\n63 - 29 = 34\n\nTherefore, Sam did not wash 34 shirts by the time school started.\n\nSo, the ultimate goal is to find the number of shirts Sam did not wash, which is 34.", "inputs": "Sure, here's a dictionary of the inputs mentioned in the client's query:\n\n{\n\"Input Name\": \"Number of short sleeve shirts\",\n\"Value\": 40\n}\n{\n\"Input Name\": \"Number of long sleeve shirts\",\n\"Value\": 23\n}\n{\n\"Input Name\": \"Number of shirts washed by school start\",\n\"Value\": 29\n}\n\nThe client's question is asking about the number of shirts that were not washed by the time school started, which can be calculated by subtracting 29 (the number of shirts washed) from the total number of shirts (40 + 23 = 63). Therefore, the answer to the client's question is 34 (63 - 29)."}

The client says that Kaleb sold 17 of his books.\n3. Now, we need to find out how much money Kaleb earned from selling his books. We don't have information about the price of each book, so we can't calculate the exact amount of money Kaleb earned. However, we can assume that Kaleb sold all 17 books for the same price, let's call it x.\n4. After selling his books, Kaleb used the money he earned to buy new books. The client mentions that Kaleb bought 7 new books.\n5. Finally, we need to find out how many books Kaleb has now. To do this, we need to add the number of books Kaleb had initially (34) to the number of new books he bought (7).\n\nSo, the final goal is to find out how many books Kaleb has now, which is:\n\n34 (initial books) + 7 (new books) = ?\n\nNow, you can solve the problem by filling in the missing number.", "inputs": "Sure, here's a dictionary of the inputs mentioned in the client's query:\n\nInputs:\n\n1.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to approach this problem:\n\nStep 1: Understand the problem\nThe client wants to organize his baseball cards in a binder with 3 cards on each page. He has 8 new cards and 10 old cards to put in the binder. The ultimate goal is to find out how many pages he will use.\n\nStep 2: Identify the information given\nThe problem statement gives us the following information:\n\n* The client has 8 new cards and 10 old cards.\n* He wants to organize the cards in a binder with 3 cards on each page.\n\nStep 3: Define the problem\nThe problem can be defined as follows:\n\n* Find the number of pages required to hold 8 new cards and 10 old cards in a binder with 3 cards on each page.\n\nStep 4: Break down the problem into smaller parts\nTo solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts as follows:\n\nPart 1: Find the total number of cards\nFirst, we need to find the total number of cards the client has. We can do this by adding the number of new cards and old cards:\n\nTotal number of cards = 8 new cards + 10 old cards\nTotal number of cards = 18\n\nPart 2: Find the number of pages required\nNext, we need to find the number of pages required to hold all the cards. We can do this by dividing the total number of cards by 3 (since there are 3 cards on each page):\n\nNumber of pages = Total number of cards \u00f7 3\nNumber of pages = 18 \u00f7 3\nNumber of pages = 6\n\nStep 5: Solve the problem\nNow that we have the number of pages required, we can answer the client's question. The client will use 6 pages in his binder to hold all 18 cards.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\nThe client will use 6 pages in his binder.", "inputs": "Sure, here's a dictionary of the inputs mentioned in the client's query:\n\n{\n\"inputs\": [\n{\n\"name\": \"number of new cards\",\n\"value\": 8\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"number of old cards\",\n\"value\": 10\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"number of cards per page\",\n\"value\": 3\n}\n]\n}\n\nThe client's query can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. Will is organizing his baseball cards in a binder with 3 cards per page.\n2. He has 8 new cards to add to the binder.\n3. He also has 10 old cards to add to the binder.\n4. The client wants to know how many pages Will will use in the binder to store all of his cards.\n\nThe inputs mentioned in the client's query are:\n\n* The number of new cards (8)\n* The number of old cards (10)\n* The number of cards per page (3)\n\nThese inputs are used to calculate the total number of cards that Will needs to store in the binder, which is 8 + 10 = 18 cards. Since each page can hold 3 cards, Will will need 18 / 3 = 6 pages to store all of his cards."}

Therefore, the cost of each toy is:\n\n8 dollars\n\nNow, let's answer the third question: how many 8 dollar toys can Frank buy with the total amount of money he has?\n\nTo find out how many toys Frank can buy, we need to divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of each toy:\n\n40 dollars / 8 dollars per toy = 5 toys\n\nTherefore, Frank can buy 5 8 dollar toys with the total amount of money he has.\n\nSo, the final answer to the client's question is: Frank can buy 5 8 dollar toys with the 40 dollars he has.", "inputs": "Sure, here's a dictionary of the inputs mentioned in the client's query:\n\nInputs:\n\n1.

Subtract the number of boxes Kaleb gave to his little brother from the total number of boxes he bought: 14 - 5 = 9\n2. Multiply the result by the number of pieces of chocolate in each box: 9 x 6 = 54\n\nTherefore, Kaleb still has 54 pieces of chocolate.\n\nI hope this step-by-step guide helps you understand how to approach this problem.

We also know that Adam had 3 tickets left after riding the ferris wheel.\n\nStep 3: Identify the unknown variable\nThe unknown variable is the number of tickets Adam used to ride the ferris wheel. We want to find out how many tickets Adam used to ride the ferris wheel so that we can calculate how much money he spent.\n\nStep 4: Relate the known variables to the unknown variable\nWe know that Adam had 3 tickets left after riding the ferris wheel, which means he used 7 tickets to ride the ferris wheel.

First, we define the total number of clothes that need to be washed, which is 59.\n2. Next, we calculate the number of clothes that can be washed in each small load by subtracting the number of clothes already in one load (32) from the total number of clothes and dividing the result by the number of small loads (9). This gives us the equation: (59 - 32) / 9 = x, where x is the number of clothes that can be washed in each small load.\n3.

The ultimate goal is to find out how many rides Tom can go on.\n\nStep 2: Identify the information given\nThe problem provides the following information:\n\n* Tom bought 40 tickets.\n* He spent 28 tickets at the dunk a clown booth.\n* Each ride costs 4 tickets.\n\nStep 3: Determine the remaining tickets\nTo find out how many rides Tom can go on, we need to determine how many tickets he has left after spending 28 tickets at the dunk a clown booth.\n\n40 - 28 = 12\n\nSo, Tom has 12 tickets left.\n\nStep 4: Divide the remaining tickets by the cost of each ride\nTo find out how many rides Tom can go on, we can divide the remaining tickets by the cost of each ride, which is 4 tickets.\n\n12 / 4 = 3\n\nSo, Tom can go on 3 rides.\n\nTherefore, the ultimate goal of the problem is to find out how many rides Tom can go on, which is 3 rides.", "inputs": "Sure, here are the inputs mentioned in the client's query:\n\nInputs:\n\n* Number of tickets bought: 40\n* Number of tickets spent at dunk a clown booth: 28\n* Number of tickets left for rides: 40 - 28 = 12\n* Cost of each ride: 4 tickets\n\nDictionary:\n{\n\"Number of tickets bought\": 40,\n\"Number of tickets spent at dunk a clown booth\": 28,\n\"Number of tickets left for rides\": 12,\n\"Cost of each ride\": 4\n}\n\nNow, to answer the client's question, we can use these inputs to calculate the number of rides Tom can go on:\n\nNumber of rides = Number of tickets left for rides / Cost of each ride\nNumber of rides = 12 / 4\nNumber of rides = 3\n\nTherefore, Tom can go on 3 rides."}
