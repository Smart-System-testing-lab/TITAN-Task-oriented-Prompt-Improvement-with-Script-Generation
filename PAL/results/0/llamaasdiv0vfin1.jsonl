First, we calculate the total number of light sources by adding the number of fireflies and glow worms.\n2. Next, we calculate the total light output by multiplying the number of fireflies by 2 (since each firefly produces 2 units of light) and adding the number of glow worms multiplied by 3 (since each glow worm produces 3 units of light).\n3. Then, we calculate the target light output by multiplying the number of fireflies by 2 and adding the number of glow worms multiplied by 3.\n4. Finally, we check if the total light output is greater than or equal to the target light output. If it is, we print \"Target achieved!\". Otherwise, we print \"More light sources are needed to achieve the target light output.\"\n\nNote that this solution assumes that each firefly and glow worm produces a constant amount of light, and that the light output is additive.
