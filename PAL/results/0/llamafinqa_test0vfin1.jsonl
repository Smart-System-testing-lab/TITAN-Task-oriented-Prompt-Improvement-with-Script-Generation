We define the `total_recourse_debt` variable with the total recourse debt value provided in the question.\n3.

We calculate the percentage of total recourse debt that is current by dividing the current portion by the total recourse debt and storing the result in the `percentage` variable.\n5. Finally, we print the percentage of total recourse debt that is current in the format requested, using the `print` function with an f-string.\n\nNote: The f-string is a way to format strings in Python, it allows us to include variables inside strings, in this case, we are using it to round the percentage to 4 decimal places and include the percentage sign.\n\"\"\"\n", "back": "Sure, I can help you with that. To find the percentage of total recourse debt that is current, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the current recourse debt: This is the amount of recourse debt that is due within the next 12 months. We can find this information in the table provided, which shows the annual maturities of recourse debt for the next few years.\n2. Calculate the total recourse debt: This is the sum of all the annual maturities of recourse debt, which is also provided in the table.\n3. Calculate the percentage of total recourse debt that is current: To do this, we need to divide the current recourse debt by the total recourse debt and multiply by 100.\n\nSo, let's follow these steps to find the answer:\n\n1. Current recourse debt: The table shows that the current recourse debt is $463 million (due in 2011), $201 million (due in 2012), $201 million (due in 2013), $497 million (due in 2014), $500 million (due in 2015), and $3152 million (due thereafter).\n2. Total recourse debt: The table shows that the total recourse debt is $4612 million.\n3. Percentage of total recourse debt that is current: To calculate this, we divide the current recourse debt by the total recourse debt and multiply by 100:\n\n(Current recourse debt \u00f7 Total recourse debt) x 100%\n\n= ($463 million + $201 million + $201 million + $497 million + $500 million + $3152 million) \u00f7 $4612 million\n\n= 0.9375 or 93.75%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of total recourse debt that is current is approximately 93.75%.", "inputs": "{\n\"inputs\": [\n{\n\"name\": \"annual maturities\",\n\"value\": \"$ 463\"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"annual maturities\",\n\"value\": \"$ 2014\"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"annual maturities\",\n\"value\": \"$ 2014\"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"annual maturities\",\n\"value\": \"$ 497\"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"annual maturities\",\n\"value\": \"$ 500\"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"annual maturities\",\n\"value\": \"$ 3152\"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"total recourse debt\",\n\"value\": \"$ 4612\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nThe question asked by the client is: what percent of total recourse debt is current?\n\nTo answer this question, we need to calculate the percentage of total recourse debt that is current. The current portion of total recourse debt is the portion that is due within one year, which can be calculated by summing up the annual maturities for the current year and the next year.\n\nIn this case, the current portion of total recourse debt is:\n\n$463 + $2014 = $2477\n\nThe percentage of total recourse debt that is current is:\n\n$2477 / $4612 = 0.536\n\nTherefore, 53.6% of total recourse debt is current."}
