Finally, we print the percentage of total recourse debt that is current in the format requested, using the `print` function with an f-string.\n\nNote: The f-string is a way to format strings in Python, it allows us to include variables inside strings, in this case, we are using it to round the percentage to 4 decimal places and include the percentage sign.\n\"\"\"\n", "back": "Sure, I can help you with that. To find the percentage of total recourse debt that is current, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the current recourse debt: This is the amount of recourse debt that is due within the next 12 months. We can find this information in the table provided, which shows the annual maturities of recourse debt for the next few years.\n2. Calculate the total recourse debt: This is the sum of all the annual maturities of recourse debt, which is also provided in the table.\n3. Calculate the percentage of total recourse debt that is current: To do this, we need to divide the current recourse debt by the total recourse debt and multiply by 100.\n\nSo, let's follow these steps to find the answer:\n\n1. Current recourse debt: The table shows that the current recourse debt is $463 million (due in 2011), $201 million (due in 2012), $201 million (due in 2013), $497 million (due in 2014), $500 million (due in 2015), and $3152 million (due thereafter).\n2. Total recourse debt: The table shows that the total recourse debt is $4612 million.\n3.

The current portion of total recourse debt is the portion that is due within one year, which can be calculated by summing up the annual maturities for the current year and the next year.\n\nIn this case, the current portion of total recourse debt is:\n\n$463 + $2014 = $2477\n\nThe percentage of total recourse debt that is current is:\n\n$2477 / $4612 = 0.536\n\nTherefore, 53.6% of total recourse debt is current."}

This gives us the following calculation:\n\nPercentage change in revenue = (Total revenue in 2016 - Total revenue in 2015) / Total revenue in 2015\n= ($1909 million - $1336 million) / $1336 million\n= 43.7%\n\nTherefore, the percentage change in revenue generated from non-US currencies from 2015 to 2016 is 43.7%.", "inputs": "{\n\"inputs\": [\n{\n\"name\": \"revenue generated from non-US currencies in 2015\",\n\"value\": $1336 million\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"revenue generated from non-US currencies in 2016\",\n\"value\": $1909 million\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"percentage change in revenue from 2015 to 2016\",\n\"value\": (($1909 million - $1336 million) / $1336 million) * 100%\n}\n]\n}\n\nThe percentage change in revenue generated from non-US currencies from 2015 to 2016 is (($1909 million - $1336 million) / $1336 million) * 100% = 43.77%."}

Calculate the percentage decrease between the two values.\n\nNow, let's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. Identify the cash flows provided by operating activities in 2010 and 2009:\n\nFrom the given table, we can see that the cash flows provided by operating activities in 2010 were $515.2 million, and in 2009, they were $559.7 million.\n\n2. Calculate the difference between the two values:\n\nTo calculate the difference, we need to subtract the 2009 value from the 2010 value:\n\n$515.2 million - $559.7 million = -$44.5 million\n\n3. Calculate the percentage decrease between the two values:\n\nTo calculate the percentage decrease, we can use the following formula:\n\nPercentage decrease = (Decrease in value / Original value) x 100\n\nIn this case, the decrease in value is -$44.5 million, and the original value is $559.7 million. So, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nPercentage decrease = (-$44.5 million / $559.7 million) x 100\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nPercentage decrease = -0.0796 x 100\n\nTherefore, the percentage decrease in cash flows from operations from 2009 to 2010 was approximately -7.96%.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is: The percentage decrease in cash flows from operations from 2009 to 2010 was approximately -7.96%.", "inputs": "{\n\"inputs\": [\n{\n\"name\": \"cash flows provided by operating activities in 2010\",\n\"value\": $515.2\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"cash flows provided by operating activities in 2009\",\n\"value\": $559.7\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"cash flows provided by operating activities in 2008\",\n\"value\": $627.6\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"cash flows used in investing activities in 2010\",\n\"value\": -$110.2\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"cash flows used in investing activities in 2009\",\n\"value\": -$581.4\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"cash flows used in investing activities in 2008\",\n\"value\": -$418.0\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"cash flows provided by financing activities in 2010\",\n\"value\": -$459.6\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"cash flows provided by financing activities in 2009\",\n\"value\": $100.8\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"cash flows provided by financing activities in 2008\",\n\"value\": -$205.5\n}\n]\n}\n\nNow, let's calculate the percentage decrease in cash flows from operations from 2009 to 2010:\n\nPercentage decrease = (Cash flows from operations in 2010 - Cash flows from operations in 2009) / Cash flows from operations in 2009\n\n= ($515.2 - $559.7) / $559.7\n\n= -7.6%\n\nTherefore, the percentage decrease in cash flows from operations from 2009 to 2010 is -7.6%."}

The cash payments for the third quarter are $0.7 million (severance and related charges) + $3.6 million (lease termination costs) + $0.4 million (canceled contracts) = $4.7 million.\n\nThe cash payments for the fourth quarter are not specified in the given information, but we can assume that they are the same as the cash payments for the third quarter, which is $4.7 million.\n\nTherefore, the total cash payments for the year 1999 are $4.7 million + $4.7 million = $9.4 million.\n\nStep 3: Find the net change in the balance of accrual related to restructurings during 1999.\n\nWe can find the net change in the balance of accrual related to restructurings during 19", "inputs": "{\n\"accrued balance at november 27 1998\": 8867,\n\"total charges\": 2014,\n\"cash payments\": -6221,\n\"adjustments\": -1874,\n\"accrued balance at december 3 1999\": 772\n}\n\nThe net change in the balance of accrual related to restructurings during 1999 is:\n\n8867 - 2014 + 6221 - 1874 = 772\n\nThe balance of accrual related to restructurings decreased by 772 during 1999."}

The table shows the changes in the company's gross liability, excluding interest and penalties, for unrecognized tax benefits.\n\nStep 2: Understand the question.\n\nThe question asks for the net change in tax positions in 2014. To calculate the net change, we need to find the increase in tax positions during 2014 and subtract the decrease in tax positions during 2014.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the increase in tax positions during 2014.\n\nAccording to the table, the increase in tax positions during 2014 is $53,818. This is the amount by which the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits increased during 2014.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the decrease in tax positions during 2014.\n\nAccording to the table, the decrease in tax positions during 2014 is $36,528.

Therefore, we can locate the data for the S&P 500 index for the relevant years 2004 to 2007.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the growth rate of the S&P 500 index for each year.\n\nWe can calculate the growth rate of the S&P 500 index for each year by subtracting the previous year's value from the current year's value and then dividing the result by the previous year's value. This will give us the growth rate for each year.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the compound growth rate for the entire period.\n\nTo calculate the compound growth rate for the entire period, we can use the formula for compound growth rate, which is:\n\nCompound growth rate = (End value / Beginning value)^(1/Number of years) - 1\n\nWhere:\n\n* End value is the value of the S&P 500 index at the end of the period (2007).\n* Beginning value is the value of the S&P 500 index at the beginning of the period (2004).\n* Number of years is the number of years between the beginning and end values (3 years in this case).\n\nBy plugging in the values, we can calculate the compound growth rate for the entire period.\n\nTherefore, the growth rate of the S&P 500 index from December 31, 2004 to 2007 is (102.11/100.00)^(1/3) - 1 = 2.11% per year.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is ", "inputs": "{\n\"inputs\": [\n{\n\"name\": \"starting point\",\n\"value\": \"December 31, 2004\"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"ending point\",\n\"value\": \"December 31, 2007\"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"S&P 500 index\",\n\"value\": \"100.00\"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"S&P 500 index (2005)\",\n\"value\": \"104.91\"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"S&P 500 index (2006)\",\n\"value\": \"121.48\"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"S&P 500 index (2007)\",\n\"value\": \"128.16\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nThe growth rate of the S&P 500 index from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2007 can be calculated as follows:\n\n((128.16 - 100.00) / 100.00) * 100 = 28.16%\n\nTherefore, the growth rate of the S&P 500 index from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2007 was 28.16%."}

The volume for 2007 is 1451 thousand barrels per day.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the percentage of pipeline barrels handled that consisted of crude oil trunk lines in 2007.\n\nTo calculate the percentage, we need to divide the volume of crude oil trunk lines handled (1451 thousand barrels per day) by the total volume of pipeline barrels handled (2500 thousand barrels per day) and multiply by 100.\n\nPercentage of pipeline barrels handled that consisted of crude oil trunk lines in 2007 = (1451 / 2500) x 100 = 58.04%\n\nTherefore, approximately 58.04% of pipeline barrels handled consisted of crude oil trunk lines in 2007.", "inputs": "{\n\"inputs\": [\n{\n\"name\": \"crude oil trunk lines\",\n\"value\": 1451\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"refined products trunk lines\",\n\"value\": 1049\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"total\",\n\"value\": 2500\n}\n]\n}\n\nThe client's question is asking for the percentage of pipeline barrels handled that consisted of crude oil trunk lines in 2007.\n\nTo calculate this, we need to divide the number of barrels of crude oil trunk lines (1451) by the total number of barrels handled (2500), and then multiply by 100.\n\nSo, the percentage of pipeline barrels handled that consisted of crude oil trunk lines in 2007 is:\n\n(1451 / 2500) * 100 = 58.04%"}

To project the risk-free interest rate for 2006, we need to follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Determine the historical risk-free interest rate trend\n\nFrom the given information, we can see that the risk-free interest rate has increased from 2.92% in 2003 to 3.87% in 2005. This indicates a growing trend in risk-free interest rates over the past few years.\n\nStep 2: Identify the factors affecting risk-free interest rates\n\nRisk-free interest rates are influenced by factors such as inflation, economic growth, and monetary policy. We need to consider these factors when projecting future risk-free interest rates.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the economic conditions in 2006\n\nAccording to economic data, 2006 was a year of moderate economic growth, with inflation under control. This suggests that the risk-free interest rate may continue to rise, but at a moderate pace.\n\nStep 4: Use the historical trend and economic conditions to project the risk-free interest rate for 2006\n\nBased on the historical trend and economic conditions, we can project the risk-free interest rate for 2006 to be around 4% to 4.5%. This is higher than the 2005 rate of 3.87%, but still within the moderate pace of increase observed in recent years.\n\nTherefore, assuming the same rate of growth as in 2005, the projected risk-free interest rate for 2006 would be around 4% to 4.5%.", "inputs": "{\n\"risk-free interest rate\": 3.87%\n\"expected dividend yield\": 2014\n\"expected option term in years\": 7.5 years\n\"assumed stock price volatility\": 84%\n}\n\nThe client is asking for the projected risk-free interest rate in 2006, assuming the same rate of growth as in 2005.\n\nThe risk-free interest rate in 2005 was 3.87%. The client wants to know what the projected risk-free interest rate would be in 2006, assuming the same rate of growth as in 2005.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to first determine the rate of growth of the risk-free interest rate between 2004 and 2005. We can do this by subtracting the risk-free interest rate in 2004 (2.56%) from the risk-free interest rate in 2005 (3.87%):\n\n3.87% - 2.56% = 1.31%\n\nThis means that the risk-free interest rate grew by 1.31% between 2004 and 2005.\n\nNext, we need to apply this rate of growth to the risk-free interest rate in 2005 to project the risk-free interest rate in 2006. We can do this by adding the rate of growth (1.31%) to the risk-free interest rate in 2005 (3.87%):\n\n3.87% + 1.31% = 5.18%\n\nTherefore, the projected risk-free interest rate in 2006, assuming the same rate of growth as in 2005, would be 5.18%."}

Therefore, we need to identify the relevant information for these three years.\n\nStep 3: Extract the information related to construction-in-progress impairment charges for each year.\n\nFor 2003:\n\n* The company wrote-off approximately $9.2 million of construction-in-progress costs.\n\nFor 2004:\n\n* The company wrote-off approximately $4.6 million of construction-in-progress costs.\n\nFor 2005:\n\n* The company wrote-off approximately $2.3 million of construction-in-progress costs.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the average write-off.\n\nTo calculate the average write-off, we need to add the amounts for each year and divide by the number of years.\n\nAverage write-off = (9.2 + 4.6 + 2.3) / 3\nAverage write-off = 16.1 / 3\nAverage write-off = 5.37\n\nTherefore, the average write-off of construction-in-progress impairment charges from 2003 to 2005 is approximately $5.37 million.", "inputs": "{\n\"inputs\": [\n{\n\"name\": \"year\",\n\"value\": 2003\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"construction-in-progress impairment charges\",\n\"value\": 9.2\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"year\",\n\"value\": 2004\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"construction-in-progress impairment charges\",\n\"value\": 4.6\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"year\",\n\"value\": 2005\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"construction-in-progress impairment charges\",\n\"value\": 2.3\n}\n]\n}\n\nThe average write-off of construction-in-progress impairment charges from 2003 to 2005 is (9.2 + 4.6 + 2.3) / 3 = 5.7 million."}

To find the amount of interest applied to the annual long-term debt maturities in 2018, we need to follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Find the long-term debt maturities for 2018.\n\nAccording to the table provided, the long-term debt maturities for 2018 are $76,000,000.\n\nStep 2: Find the interest rate applied to the long-term debt maturities.\n\nThe interest rate applied to the long-term debt maturities is not explicitly stated in the provided table. However, we can find the interest rate by looking at the note that corresponds to the long-term debt maturities.\n\nNote 10 to the financial statements mentions that the long-term debt maturities include lease obligations and long-term DOE obligations. The interest rate for these obligations is not stated, but we can assume that it is similar to the interest rate for the other long-term debt maturities.\n\nAssuming the interest rate for the long-term debt maturities is similar to the interest rate for the other long-term debt maturities, we can estimate the interest rate based on the information provided in the table.\n\nThe table shows that the weighted-average interest rate for the long-term debt maturities is 7.458% (7.458%). This means that the interest rate for the long-term debt maturities is approximately 7.458%.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the interest applied to the long-term debt maturities for 2018.\n\nTo calculate the interest applied to the long-term debt maturities for 2018, we can use the formula:\n\nInterest = Principal x Rate x Time\n\nWhere:\n\n* Principal is the long-term debt maturities for 2018, which is $76,000,000.\n* Rate is the interest rate applied to the long-term debt maturities, which is approximately 7.458%.", "inputs": "{\n\"inputs\": [\n{\n\"name\": \"annual long-term debt maturities\",\n\"value\": \"$760,000\"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"implicit interest rate\",\n\"value\": \"7.458%\"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"long-term doe obligations\",\n\"value\": \"$183,000,000\"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"lease obligations\",\n\"value\": \"$34,000,000\"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"debt due within one year\",\n\"value\": \"$130,443,100\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nThe client's question is asking for the amount of interest applied to the annual long-term debt maturities in 2018, which can be calculated by multiplying the annual long-term debt maturities by the implicit interest rate.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the client's question is:\n\nInterest applied to annual long-term debt maturities in 2018 = $760,000 x 7.458% = $56,177"}

Amount of the company's contribution to U.S. pension plans in 2011:\n\nAccording to the table, the company contributed $517 million to its U.S. and international pension plans in 2011. Since the question only refers to the U.S. pension contributions, we need to subtract the amount contributed to international pension plans. The table does not provide the exact amount of the international pension contributions, but it does state that the majority of international pension contributions expire in six years with the remaining international expiring in one year or with an indefinite carryover period. Therefore, we can assume that the amount of international pension contributions is relatively small compared to the U.S. pension contributions. For the purpose of this calculation, let's assume that the amount of international pension contributions is negligible.\n\nTherefore, the amount of the company's contribution to U.S. pension plans in 2011 is:\n\n$517 million - $0 (international pension contributions) = $517 million\n\n2.

As before, we need to subtract the amount contributed to international pension plans. Assuming that the amount of international pension contributions is still negligible, we can calculate the amount of the company's contribution to U.S. pension plans in 2013 as follows:\n\n$476 million - $0 (international pension contributions) = $47", "inputs": "{\n\"inputs\": [\n{\n\"name\": \"company contribution 2011\",\n\"value\": \"$517 million\"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"company contribution 2013\",\n\"value\": \"$476 million\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nThe ratio of the company's contribution in 2011 to the amount in 2013 to the US pension contributions is:\n\n$517 million (2011) / $476 million (2013) = 1.09\n\nSo, the ratio is approximately 1.09, meaning that the company's contribution to US pension plans in 2011 was about 9% higher than in 2013."}

As of September 30, 2018, the company had liabilities of $70.4 million related to estimated interest and penalties for unrecognized tax benefits.\n\nStep 3: Add the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits and the amount of interest and penalties to find the total balance in 2018.\n\nTherefore, the total balance in 2018, including interest and penalty liabilities, would be:\n\n$127.1 million (unrecognized tax benefits) + $70.4 million (interest and penalties) = $197.5 million\n\nSo, the total balance in 2018, including interest and penalty liabilities, was $197.5 million.", "inputs": "{\n\"inputs\": [\n{\n\"name\": \"balance at beginning of fiscal year\",\n\"value\": $148.9\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"additions related to purchase accounting\",\n\"value\": $3.4\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"additions for tax positions taken in current year\",\n\"value\": $3.1\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"additions for tax positions taken in prior fiscal years\",\n\"value\": $18.0\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"reductions for tax positions taken in prior fiscal years\",\n\"value\": -$5.3\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"reductions due to settlement\",\n\"value\": -$29.4\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"reductions as a result of a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations\",\n\"value\": -$2.0\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"balance at end of fiscal year\",\n\"value\": $127.1\n}\n]\n}\n\nThe total balance in 2018, including interest and penalty liabilities, would be $127.1 million, as mentioned in the last line of the table."}
