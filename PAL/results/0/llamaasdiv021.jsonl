It sounds like the client is asking for help with a math problem.\n\nStep 1: Understand the problem statement\nThe client has told us that Mrs. Hilt picked up a book with 17 pages and read 11 of them. Our goal is to find out how many pages Mrs. Hilt has left to read.\n\nStep 2: Identify the relevant information\nWe know that the book has 17 pages, and Mrs. Hilt has read 11 of them. This means that there are 6 pages left that Mrs. Hilt has not read yet.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the result\nTo find out how many pages Mrs. Hilt has left to read, we need to subtract the number of pages she has read (11) from the total number of pages in the book (17). This gives us:\n\n17 - 11 = 6\n\nSo, Mrs. Hilt has 6 pages left to read.\n\nStep 4: Interpret the result\nThe result of our calculation, 6, represents the number of pages that Mrs. Hilt has left to read. This means that Mrs. Hilt has finished reading 11 pages and has 6 pages remaining to finish the book.\n\nStep 5: Provide the answer\nThe client's goal is to find out how many pages Mrs. Hilt has left to read. Our answer is 6 pages.\n\nIn summary, the client wants to know how many pages Mrs. Hilt has left to read in the book she picked up. By understanding the problem statement, identifying the relevant information, calculating the result, interpreting the result, and providing the answer, we have helped the client achieve their goal."}

So, the client has told us that Isabella's hair is 18 cubes long, and they want to know how long it will be if it grows 4 more inches. Let's break down their goal step by step:\n\nStep 1: Convert the length of Isabella's hair from cubes to inches.\nThe client has given us the length of Isabella's hair in cubes, but we need to convert it to inches to work with a measurable unit. Let's assume that one cube is equal to 1 inch, so we can convert 18 cubes to 18 inches.\n\nStep 2: Determine how much Isabella's hair will grow with 4 more inches.\nThe client has told us that Isabella's hair will grow 4 more inches. So, we need to calculate how much her hair will grow in total. In this case, 4 inches is equal to 4/12 = 0.33 feet.\n\nStep 3: Add the growth rate to the original length of Isabella's hair.\nNow, we need to add the growth rate (0.33 feet) to the original length of Isabella's hair (18 inches or 1.5 feet). When we do that, we get:\n\n1.5 feet + 0.33 feet = 1.83 feet\n\nStep 4: Calculate the new length of Isabella's hair in inches.\nFinally, we need to convert the new length of Isabella's hair from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so we can multiply the new length in feet (1.83 feet) by 12 to get:\n\n1.83 feet x 12 inches/foot = 22.08 inches\n\nSo, the client wants to know how long Isabella's hair will be if it grows 4 more inches, and we have calculated that it will be approximately 22.08 inches long.
