                Sure, here's a Python function that solves the problem:

```python
import math

def solution():
    # Initialize a dictionary to store items and their costs
    items = {
        "milk": 2,
        "eggs": 3,
        "light bulbs": 3,
        "cups": 3,
        "roach traps": 4
    }

    # Calculate the cost of non-food items before tax
    non_food_cost = sum(item[1] for item in items.items() if item[0] not in ["milk", "eggs"])

    # Calculate the tax on non-food items
    tax = non_food_cost * 0.10

    # Calculate the total cost of non-food items
    non_food_total = non_food_cost + tax

    # Calculate the total cost of all items
    total_cost = non_food_total + items["milk"] + items["eggs"]

    # Print the result
    print(f"target: {total_cost:.2f}")
```

The function first initializes a dictionary to store the items and their costs. It then calculates the cost of non-food items before tax, and then calculates the tax on non-food items using the 10% tax rate. The function then calculates the total cost of non-food items by adding the cost before tax and the tax. Finally, the function calculates the total cost of all items by adding the total cost of non-food items, milk, eggs, and roach traps. The result is then printed in the format requested.
