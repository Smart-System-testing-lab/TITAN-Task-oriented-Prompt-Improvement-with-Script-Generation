                Sure, here's a Python function that solves the problem:

```python
def solution():
    plates = {
        1: 5,
        2: 7,
        3: 10,
        4: 14,
        5: 19
    }

    # Identify the pattern
    pattern = [plate - plates[plate - 1] for plate in plates]

    # Check if the pattern is consistent
    if all(plate - plates[plate - 1] == 2 for plate in plates):
        # If the pattern is consistent, use it to predict the 6th plate
        sixth_plate = plates[5] + 2
        print(f"target: {sixth_plate}")
    else:
        # If the pattern is not consistent, re-examine it
        new_pattern = [plate - plates[plate - 1] for plate in plates]
        sixth_plate = plates[5] + new_pattern[5]
        print(f"target: {sixth_plate}")

```

Explanation:

1. First, we define a dictionary `plates` that maps the plate number to the number of cookies on that plate.
2. Next, we create a list `pattern` that contains the difference between consecutive plates. We do this by subtracting the number of cookies on each plate from the number of cookies on the previous plate.
3. We then check if the pattern is consistent by using a list comprehension to check if the difference between consecutive plates is always 2 cookies.
4. If the pattern is consistent, we use it to predict the number of cookies on the sixth plate by adding 2 cookies to the number of cookies on the fifth plate.
5. If the pattern is not consistent, we re-examine it by creating a new list `new_pattern` that contains the difference between consecutive plates. We then use this new pattern to predict the number of cookies on the sixth plate.
6. Finally, we print the predicted number of cookies on the sixth plate using the `print` function.

Note that this solution assumes that the pattern in the problem statement is correct, and that there are no errors
