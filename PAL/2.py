                Sure, here's a possible implementation of the `solution()` function in Python:
```python
def solution():
    oranges_per_glass = 2
    glasses_made = 6
    total_oranges = oranges_per_glass * glasses_made
    print(f"target: {total_oranges}")
```
This function takes no input, as the values for `oranges_per_glass` and `glasses_made` are already provided in the question. It simply calculates the total number of oranges used based on those values and prints the result in the format requested.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `oranges_per_glass = 2`: This line sets a variable `oranges_per_glass` to the value of 2, which is the number of oranges used per glass of juice.
2. `glasses_made = 6`: This line sets a variable `glasses_made` to the value of 6, which is the number of glasses of juice made by the client.
3. `total_oranges = oranges_per_glass * glasses_made`: This line calculates the total number of oranges used by multiplying the number of oranges per glass by the number of glasses made.
4. `print(f"target: {total_oranges}"): This line prints the result in the format requested, which is "target: [total number of oranges]"

When you run this function, it should output:
```
target: 12
```
Which is the total number of oranges used to make 6 glasses of fresh orange juice.
