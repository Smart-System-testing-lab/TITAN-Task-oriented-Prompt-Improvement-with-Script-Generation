def solution():
    # Since the task is abstract and does not provide specific numerical inputs or a clear mathematical problem to solve,
    # the following code is a placeholder to demonstrate how one might structure a solution if specific details were given.
    # This code does not perform any real calculation related to the scenario described but is meant to illustrate the approach.

    # Placeholder variables (these would be based on actual data if provided)
    daily_egg_production = 10  # Example: Number of eggs produced by ducks daily
    personal_consumption = 2  # Example: Number of eggs used daily for personal consumption
    eggs_for_baking = 3  # Example: Number of eggs used for baking muffins for friends
    eggs_for_sale = daily_egg_production - (personal_consumption + eggs_for_baking)  # Remaining eggs for sale
    price_per_egg = 0.5  # Example: Selling price per egg at the farmers' market

    # Calculating daily earnings from selling eggs
    daily_earnings = eggs_for_sale * price_per_egg

    # Since the task requests a one-line summary without specific details, the following is a placeholder output.
    # In a real scenario, the output would reflect the actual calculation based on provided inputs.
    print(f"target: {daily_earnings:.1f}")
