                def solution():
        # Initialize variables
        total_croissants = 59

        # Calculate the number of croissants left with Marian

This code first initializes three variables: `total_croissants`, `number_of_neighbors`, and `equal_distribution`. These variables represent the total number of croissants prepared by Marian, the number of neighbors receiving croissants, and the number of croissants each neighbor will receive (assuming an equal distribution).

The code then calculates the number of croissants left with Marian by subtracting the product of the number of neighbors and the equal distribution from the total number of croissants. This calculation is performed in the line: `croissants_left = total_croissants - (number_of_neighbors * equal_distribution)`.

Finally, the code prints the result using the `print` function, which outputs the message "target: [number of croissants left with Marian]".

Note that the input values for the variables are hardcoded in the code. If you want to prompt the user for input, you can modify the code to use input() function to get the input values. For example:
```python
total_croissants = int(input("Enter the total number of croissants prepared by Marian: "))
number_of_neighbors = int(input("Enter the number of neighbors receiving croissants: "))
equal_distribution = int(input("Enter the number of croissants each neighbor will receive (assuming equal distribution): "))
```
This will prompt the user to enter the input values, which will be stored in the corresponding variables.
