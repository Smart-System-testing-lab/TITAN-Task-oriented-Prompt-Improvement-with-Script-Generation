                Sure, here's a Python function that solves the problem:
```python
def solution():
    dan_money = 4
    candy_bar_cost = 8
    friend_gift = 5
    result = dan_money - candy_bar_cost + friend_gift
    print(f"Target: {result:.2f}")
```
Explanation:

1. First, we define the variables for the amounts of money involved: `dan_money`, `candy_bar_cost`, and `friend_gift`.
2. We calculate the result by subtracting the cost of the candy bar from Dan's initial amount of money, and then adding the amount of money that Dan's friend gave him.
3. Finally, we print the result using the `print()` function, with the format specifier `f` to display the result as a decimal number with two digits after the decimal point. The `target` keyword is used to indicate that this is the target amount of money that Dan should have after buying the candy bar and receiving the gift from his friend.
