This code defines the three options and the requirement, then checks if each option meets the requirement by checking if the string "uiiu" is not present in the option. If an option meets the requirement, it prints the option as the target. If none of the options meet the requirement, it prints a message indicating that.

It's important to note that this code assumes that the requirement is that the word should not have the letters "uiiu" in it, and that the letters "uiiu" are not present in any of the options. If this is not the case, the code will need to be modified accordingly.

Also, this code is written in Python 3.x, if you are using Python 2.x, you might need to make some changes to the code to make it work.
