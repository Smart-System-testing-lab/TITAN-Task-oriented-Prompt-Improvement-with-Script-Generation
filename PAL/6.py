                Sure, here's a Python function that solves the problem:

```
def solution():
    initial_amount = 11
    birthday_money = 18
    game_cost = 10
    result = initial_amount + birthday_money - game_cost
    print(f"target : {result}")
```

Explanation:

1. First, we define the variables for the initial amount of money Henry had, the amount of money he received for his birthday, and the amount of money he spent on a new game.
2. We calculate the result by adding the initial amount of money Henry had and the amount of money he received for his birthday, and then subtracting the amount of money he spent on a new game.
3. Finally, we print the result in the format requested by the client.

Note: The format string f"target : {result}" is used to print the result in the desired format. The f"target : " part is a string literal, and {result} is the variable that contains the result of the calculation.
