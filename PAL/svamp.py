                Sure, here's a possible implementation of the `solution()` function that solves the problem described in the prompt:
```python
def solution():
    # Extract the inputs from the dictionary
    reading_pages = 4
    math_pages = 7
    biology_pages = 19

    # Calculate the difference between math and reading homework
    difference = math_pages - reading_pages

    # Print the result
    print(f"target : {difference:.0f}")
```
This function first extracts the values of the `reading homework pages`, `math homework pages`, and `biology homework pages` inputs from the dictionary. Then, it calculates the difference between the number of pages of math homework and reading homework by subtracting the former from the latter. Finally, it prints the result in the format specified in the prompt, which is a string in the form `target : X.X`, where `X.X` is the difference between the two values, rounded to one decimal place.

Note that this implementation assumes that the inputs are valid and that the difference between the two values is a floating-point number. If either of these assumptions is violated, the function may not work correctly. Additionally, this implementation does not handle the case where the difference is zero; if that is a possibility, additional logic would be needed to handle it appropriately.
