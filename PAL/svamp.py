                Sure, here's a Python function that solves the problem:
```python
def solution():
    # Number of children riding on the bus initially
    initial_kids = 2

    # Total number of children on the bus after the bus stop
    total_kids = 10

    # Calculate the difference between the total number of children and the initial number of children
    diff = total_kids - initial_kids

    # Print the result
    print(f"target: {diff}")
```
Explanation:

1. We first define the three inputs: `initial_kids` (2), `total_kids` (10), and `diff` (unknown).
2. We calculate the difference between the total number of children and the initial number of children: `diff = total_kids - initial_kids`.
3. We print the result in the format requested: `print(f"target: {diff}")`

Note: The `f` string syntax is used to include the variable `diff` in the string, so that the output is formatted as "target: X", where X is the calculated difference.
