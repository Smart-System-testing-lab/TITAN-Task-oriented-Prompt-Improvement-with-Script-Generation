                Sure, here's a Python function that solves the problem:

```python
def solution():
    total_cakes = 155
    friend_bought = 140
    remaining_cakes = total_cakes - friend_bought
    print(f"target: {remaining_cakes}")
```

Explanation:

1. We define a function named `solution()` that takes no arguments.
2. We define three variables: `total_cakes`, `friend_bought`, and `remaining_cakes`.
3. We assign the values given in the problem to `total_cakes` and `friend_bought`.
4. We calculate the number of cakes Baker still has by subtracting `friend_bought` from `total_cakes`. We store this value in `remaining_cakes`.
5. We print the value of `remaining_cakes` in the format required by the client.

Note: The `f` string syntax is used to include the variable `remaining_cakes` in the string. This way, we don't have to concatenate strings and can directly insert the variable value into the string.
