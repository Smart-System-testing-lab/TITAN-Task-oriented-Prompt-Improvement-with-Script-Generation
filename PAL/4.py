                Sure, here's a Python function that solves the problem:
```python
def solution():
    daily_consumption = 1
    carton_size = 15
    cost_per_carton = 4.00
    days = 60

    total_consumption = daily_consumption * days
    cartons_needed = total_consumption // carton_size
    remaining_servings = total_consumption % carton_size

    cost = cartons_needed * cost_per_carton
    cost += remaining_servings * (cost_per_carton / carton_size)

    print(f"target : {cost:.2f}")
```
This function takes no input, as all the necessary values are provided in the dictionary. It calculates the total cost of ice cream consumed by Cynthia over 60 days, considering that she eats one serving per day and that each carton contains 15 servings. The function then prints the result in the format requested.
